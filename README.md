## **About the project**

- Inspired in how [Discord](https://discord.com/) implemented a real-time messaging, video communication, and VoIP application, this is my attempt to create something similar, open-sourced.

---

## **Planned Architecture**

- **Asynchronous**

  - To maximize performance, the app should be fully asynchronous.

- **Modular**

  - To be fully feature-customizable, each components/features should be as loosely coupled as possible.

- **Microservice Pattern**
  - To improve scalability, each components/features should be running as a service
